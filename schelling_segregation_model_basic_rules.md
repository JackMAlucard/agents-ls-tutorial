- A fixed pre-determined number of agents exist in the model.
- Agents belong to one of two groups (1 or 2).
- The agents live in a two-dimensional non-periodic grid.
- Only one agent per position is allowed.
- At each state of the simulation, each agent looks at its 8 neighboring positions (cardinal and diagonal directions). It then counts how many neighboring agents belong to the same group (if any). This leads to 8 neighboring positions per position (except at the edges of the grid).
- If an agent has at least min_to_be_happy neighbors belonging to the same group, then it becomes happy.
- Else, the agent is unhappy and moves to a new random location in space while respecting the 1-agent-per-position rule.
